# Working with Azure Blob Storage using ASP.NET Core – Upload, Download & Delete Files 

![Azure Blob Storage using ASP.NET Core](https://codewithmukesh.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Working-with-AWS-S3-using-ASP.NET-Core.png)

In this project, we demonstrate working with Azure Blob Storage using ASP.NET Core Web API to upload, download and delete files from Microsoft's scalable Azure Blob Storage! This includes managing containers (equivalent to S3 buckets), handling blob operations, generating SAS tokens for pre-signed URLs, and integrating with Azure Identity for authentication.

## Topics Covered:

- Azure Blob Storage – Overview
- Azure Identity and DefaultAzureCredential Authentication
- Creating and Managing Blob Containers via Azure Portal
- Azure Blob Storage Configuration & SDK
- Working with Azure Blob Storage using ASP.NET Core – Getting Started
  - Working with Blob Containers : Creating Containers, Getting a List of Containers, Deleting Containers, Testing
  - File Operations in Azure Blob Storage : Upload Files to Blob Storage, Get All Blobs in a Container, Download Files from Blob Storage, Delete Blobs, Testing File Operations
	   
*Complete Source Code Included!

This project has been migrated from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage, demonstrating equivalent functionality using Azure's storage services.
